This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Authentication

For the sake of simplicity, the Authentication backend by Okta has been used.

The following credentials can be used for quick login.

username: chuck@example.com
Password: Norris@1234

UI is nice and clean, thanks largely to bootstrap.

The user cannot access data tab/route, unless logged in.
